PHASE 0 COMPLETE: DELETE ALL 86 DUPLICATE FILES
================================================
Date: October 23, 2025
Status: COMPLETE ✅ - WAITING FOR MANUAL COMMIT

EXECUTION SUMMARY
-----------------

Command Used:
  find src -name "* [2-9].*" -type f -exec git rm {} \;

Results:
  ✅ Duplicates deleted: 86
  ✅ Duplicates remaining: 0
  ✅ Deletions staged: 86
  ✅ All canonical files intact: YES

BREAKDOWN
---------
- Components: 6 files
- Services: 15 files
- Repositories: 16 files
- Store Slices: 22 files
- Types: 10 files
- Validation: 8 files
- Config: 2 files
- Interceptors: 3 files
- Providers: 4 files

WHY DUPLICATES KEPT REAPPEARING
--------------------------------
Previous deletions used `rm` instead of `git rm`, so files remained 
git-tracked and kept "reappearing". Now properly deleted with `git rm`.

NEXT STEPS (MANUAL)
-------------------

1. Commit the staged deletions:

   git commit -m "Phase 0: Delete 86 duplicate files (numbered 2-9)
   
   - Removed all git-tracked duplicate files with numbers 2, 3, 4
   - Categories: components (6), services (15), repositories (16), 
     slices (22), types (10), validation (8), config (2), 
     interceptors (3), providers (4)
   - Used git rm to properly stage deletions
   - All canonical files remain intact
   - Verified: 0 duplicates remaining"

2. After commit, continue with TypeScript error fixes (Phases 3-12)

VERIFICATION
------------
✅ find src -name "* [2-9].*" | wc -l  →  0 files
✅ git status --short | grep "^D" | wc -l  →  86 deletions
