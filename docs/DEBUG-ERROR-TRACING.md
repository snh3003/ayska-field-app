# Error Tracing - Finding the Root Cause

**Date**: 2025-10-26  
**Status**: DEBUG LOGGING ADDED  
**Next Action**: RUN APP AND CHECK CONSOLE

---

## What We Added

### 1. RetryInterceptor Debug Logging

**File**: `src/interceptors/AyskaRetryInterceptor.ts` (Lines 15-24, 30-33)

Shows what error the RetryInterceptor receives from Axios.

### 2. ErrorInterceptor Debug Logging

**File**: `src/interceptors/AyskaErrorInterceptor.ts` (Lines 22-33)

Shows the complete structure of the error object when it reaches ErrorInterceptor.

### 3. TypeScript Fix

**File**: `src/di/ServiceContainer.ts` (Line 201)

Fixed type error for apiError parameter.

## Current Problem

You're seeing:

```
üî¥ API ERROR: UNKNOWN UNKNOWN
üìä Status Code: No Response
üì¶ Response Data: No response data
üìã Request Data: No request data
üîó Full URL: UNKNOWN
üí¨ User Message: An unexpected error occurred. Please try again
üîß Error Type: No error code
```

This means:

- ‚ùå **NOT a backend problem** - Backend never received the request
- ‚ùå **NOT a network problem** - Request never went out
- ‚úÖ **FRONTEND problem** - Error happens before Axios can make the HTTP request

---

## What To Do Next

### Step 1: Run the App

```bash
npm start
# Then trigger the API call that's failing (login, etc.)
```

### Step 2: Watch the Console

You should now see NEW debug logs BEFORE the error:

```
üîÑ RETRY INTERCEPTOR RECEIVED: {
  hasConfig: true/false,
  hasResponse: true/false,
  errorCode: "...",
  errorMessage: "..."
}

üîç RAW ERROR RECEIVED: {
  hasConfig: true/false,
  hasResponse: true/false,
  errorType: "object",
  errorKeys: [...array of keys],
  isAxiosError: true/false,
  rawError: {...full error object}
}
```

---

## Interpreting the Results

### Scenario A: `hasConfig: false` and `hasResponse: false`

**This means**:

- Error is NOT from Axios
- Error is thrown in your service/thunk code BEFORE HTTP request
- Likely causes:
  1. HttpClient not initialized properly
  2. Missing baseURL
  3. Error in request preparation
  4. ServiceContainer returning wrong object

**What to check**:

- Is backend server running?
- Is baseURL set in `src/config/api.ts`?
- Are you calling the right service from Redux thunk?

---

### Scenario B: `hasConfig: true` but `hasResponse: false`

**This means**:

- Request was built correctly
- Backend never responded (expected for network errors)
- This is NORMAL for:
  - Server down
  - Network disconnected
  - Timeout

**This is expected behavior** - should show "Server unavailable" or "Network error"

---

### Scenario C: Both `hasConfig: true` and `hasResponse: true`

**This means**:

- Request went out
- Backend sent a response
- Error is a proper HTTP error (404, 401, 422, etc.)
- **This is what we WANT** - our error handling should work

---

## What The Debug Logs Will Tell Us

### If `errorKeys` shows:

```javascript
errorKeys: ['message', 'code', 'title'];
```

**Problem**: Error is already a mapped `ApiError` object (not AxiosError)
**Cause**: Someone is calling `ApiErrorHandler.mapError()` too early

### If `isAxiosError: false`:

**Problem**: Not an Axios error at all
**Cause**: Regular JavaScript error being thrown somewhere

### If `rawError` is empty or has wrong structure:

**Problem**: Error object is malformed
**Cause**: Interceptor chain or promise handling issue

---

## Next Steps Based on Results

### If hasConfig is FALSE:

1. Check if ServiceContainer is initialized
2. Check if HttpClient baseURL is set
3. Add logging to AuthService to see if request is being built
4. Check Redux thunk - is it calling the service correctly?

### If hasConfig is TRUE but URL is wrong:

1. Check `src/config/api.ts` - is BASE_URL correct?
2. Check if baseURL is being passed to HttpClient constructor
3. Verify ServiceContainer is registering HttpClient with correct config

### If everything looks correct:

1. Share the debug output with me
2. We'll trace backwards from ErrorInterceptor to find where error originates

---

## Quick Checklist

Before running the app, verify:

- [ ] Backend server is running (check http://localhost:8000)
- [ ] `src/config/api.ts` has correct BASE_URL
- [ ] Metro bundler is running (npm start)
- [ ] App is in development mode (**DEV** = true)
- [ ] Console is visible (terminal or React Native Debugger)

---

## What To Share With Me

When you run the app and see the error, copy-paste:

1. **The new debug logs**:

```
üîÑ RETRY INTERCEPTOR RECEIVED: {...}
üîç RAW ERROR RECEIVED: {...}
```

2. **The full error log**:

```
üî¥ API ERROR: ...
```

3. **Any other errors** that appear before these

This will tell us EXACTLY where the problem is!

---

## Why This Matters

Without knowing WHERE the error originates, we can't fix it properly. The debug logs will show us:

- ‚úÖ Is it an Axios error or JavaScript error?
- ‚úÖ Does the error have config and response?
- ‚úÖ What keys does the error object have?
- ‚úÖ Where in the interceptor chain is it breaking?

Once we see the debug output, we'll know exactly what to fix.

**Run the app now and share the debug console output!**
